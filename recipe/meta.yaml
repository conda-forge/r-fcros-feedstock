  summary: A fold change rank based method is presented to search for genes with changing expression
    and to detect recurrent chromosomal copy number aberrations. This  method may be
    useful for high-throughput biological data (micro-array, sequencing, ...). Probabilities
    are associated with genes or probes in the data set and there is no problem of multiple
    tests when using this method. For array-based comparative genomic hybridization
    data, segmentation results are obtained by merging the significant probes detected.
